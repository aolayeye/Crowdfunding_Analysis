We can help Louise set up her incentives by first determining how much money people have pledged to campaigns historically. 
### The Analysis
The Kickstarter analysis provided the following insights to Louise
1 With the help of filters, we are able to focus on money raised by various campigns and we are able use data from the Pledged column to research projects with amounts similar Louise's monetary goal
2 A clear highlight of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns. This was achieved with the help of Conditional Formatting. This offers The ability to visually process outcomes at a glance will be very useful for Louise
3 To further assist Louise in her decision making, the analysis provides mean plegde column. This will help Louise detrmine which projets gets the most donations. we achieved this with the an average funding column ( Average Donation) Now we can quickly determine how close a campaign came to reaching---and in some cases, exceeding---their funding goal.

#### Recommendation
From these plots, we can see that the mean campaign goal is around £4,000. This is outside of the range of outliers for amount pledged, so Louise should probably try to get her play produced for less than £4,000. Half of the campaign goals are less than £2,000, which is just over the 3rd quartile for amounts pledged.
